Dataset Provenance
###################

In order to proceed with indexing a data source under Biocaddie DataMed, it is essential to provide information about the actual source of information. This means unambiguously identifying the repository, the actual material from that resource used as input to the transformation allowing processing by DataMed software agents.

This falls under the provenance information section of the DAT for DataMed.

* identify the repository
* document the **url** or **filename** and address of the source information
* document the **date of last access** to the resource as input to the data transformation
* document the data transformation pipeline in the datamed infrastructure, ideally by pointed to the biocaddie `github repository <https://github.com/biocaddie/data-pipeline/blob/master/transformations/>`_ .
